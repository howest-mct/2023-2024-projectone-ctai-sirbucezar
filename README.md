### AI Development:

**24 May**  
- Analyzed the possibilities of training the dataset solely by classification.  
- Determined this approach will not work as an initial object identification model is needed to crop the bounding box before inputting it into the classification model.

**27 May**  
- Created the dataset for the object identficiation model, annotated data that was mislabeled.  
- Tried the model through the api in VScode. It is functional, but the dataset neeeds more annotations, as well as the model has to be trained locally.

**28 May**  
- The object detection model has been trained in 10 epochs, achieving the best R2 score of 0.82
- The classification model has been trained achiueving a 50% validation result.

**29 May**
- Applied Hyperparameter Tuning to the classification model using RandomSearch with cross validation

### Build Progress:

**24 May**  
- Completed the list of materials with accurate sizing for each item.  
- Awaiting delivery to commence the build process step-by-step.

**27 May**
- Finalized the life-scaled 3D design on Tinkercad
- Started creating the illustrator files for the CNC machine.
