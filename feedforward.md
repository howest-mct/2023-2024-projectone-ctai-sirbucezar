### AI Development:

**24 May**  
- Analyzed the possibilities of training the dataset solely by classification.  
- Determined this approach will not work as an initial object identification model is needed to crop the bounding box before inputting it into the classification model.

### Build Progress:

**24 May**  
- Completed the list of materials with accurate sizing for each item.  
- Awaiting delivery to commence the build process step-by-step.
