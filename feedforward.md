___

**AI:** 

*24May* 
   - I have analysed the possibilities of training the dataset only by classification. This will not work because I will need to pass the photo through an initial object identification model, crop the boundbox, and then input it in the classification model. 


**Build:** 

*24May* 
   - I have completed the list of materials that I need with the accurate sizing of each item. I am awaiting for the delivery so I can start the build process step by step.
