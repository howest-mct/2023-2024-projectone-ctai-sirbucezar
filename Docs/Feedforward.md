# Tips for Feedback Conversations

## Preparation

> I would like to have my project run very efficiently. Git feedback will be really needed.
> Electronics: I need to manage the power input for the stepper motor externally, I would want to have good power management as well as good component management
> Maker Design Skills - What specific methods can I use for a specific type of wood etching?

## During the Conversation:

> **Listen actively:** Do not immediately go on the defensive but try to listen well. Show both verbally and non-verbally that you are paying attention to the feedback by maintaining an open posture (eye contact, upright posture), taking notes, nodding...

> **Take notes:** Write down the feedback so you have it later. Note the key words and find a quick notation method for yourself. If you take good notes, you can briefly review your main feedback points at the end of the conversation.

> **Summarize:** Do not wait for a summary from the instructors, this is your task: Check if you have understood the message correctly by actively listening and summarizing in your own words.

> **Think about it:** Consider what you are going to do with the feedback and follow up. Do you find the comments justified or unjustified? Do you recognize yourself in the feedback? How are you going to address this?

## AFTER THE CONVERSATION

> Reread your notes and create action points. Make choices from all the feedback you received: What can you work on and what will you set aside for now. What were the priorities? Review the assignment sheet again to determine your focus points. Write your action points on the feedback sheet.

# Feedforward Conversations

## Conversation 1 (Date: 29/05/2024)

Lecturer: Tijn Veraghtert

Questions for this conversation: 

- Question 1: What technique should I choose to shape a part of my maker part?
- Question 2: What is  the capacity of the laser cutter in terms of dimensions of the wood that can be processed?
- Question 3: How can I choose the right gearing for the moving part?
- Question 4: Are the electronics I have chosen suitable for the weight/complexity of the prototype?

This is the feedback on my questions.

- Feedback 1: I should use the fixed drill for creating the semi-holes. When I create the svg files, don't forget to etch the shape.
- Feedback 2: 600x450mm for wood. I should either scale down my prototype so the pieces fit in the small CNC, or use the industrial CNC(needs assistance/gets pretty busy).
- Feedback 3: I should first choose one of the 2 gears to laser cut out of acryl, and the other one shall be wooden so I can apply the modifications in sizing if needed. Use gear generator softwares for getting the right dimensions, ratios, sizing.
- Feedback 4: My electronic components seem to fit well the task I want to assign them to.
